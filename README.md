# hashmapTranslator

Creates a project called hashmapTranslator. Program loads the list of acronyms in the file 
acronyms.txt into a Map. The file is attached. The program asks the user to enter a 
sentence. The program will then replace all acronyms in the sentence with their expanded form. For 
example, the sentence:

“LOL WTH mom srsly I will be there tmrw” will be expanded into:
“Laughing out loud what the heck mom seriously I will be there tomorrow”
And the sentence “tgif dude don’t 4get to byoc 2nite” will be expanded into:
“Thank god it's friday dude don’t forget to bring your own computer tonight”

Just trying to wrap my head around the basics of Maps in Java and utilizing reading external files.
